JQUERY

jQuery is a massive, free open source javascript library.  
It's not a programming language.

Benefits

Working with DOM is easier
Animations are easier
Event handling is easier
Ajax is simple....and etc.
Allows for chaining which lets you apply different methods 
or effects to an element in one line:
    $(element).hide().show().css({height:25});
plugins are available too
    image slider plugins
    form enhancement plugins


On the DOM:
document.getElement.Id("main-heading");

On jQuery:
$("#main-heading");

YOu can use the jQuery one on the DOM but it returns an array which
is actually a jQuery object which is based on the array type.  

in order to unwrap it from the array on the DOM do the following:
var heading = $("#page-title")  //press enter
heading.css({position: "relative"}); //press enter
heading.animate({left: 100;});  //press enter and it moves it to the right

it still needs to be unwrapped from the object array type::

heading[0]
//now it returns it unwrapped!! :)

heading[0].animate({left: 20});  //will not work!  it's unwrapped so animate won't work on it anymore
