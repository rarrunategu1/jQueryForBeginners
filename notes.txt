JQUERY

jQuery is a massive, free open source javascript library.  
It's not a programming language.

Benefits

Working with DOM is easier
Animations are easier
Event handling is easier
Ajax is simple....and etc.
Allows for chaining which lets you apply different methods 
or effects to an element in one line:
    $(element).hide().show().css({height:25});
plugins are available too
    image slider plugins
    form enhancement plugins


On the DOM:
document.getElement.Id("main-heading");

On jQuery:
$("#main-heading");

YOu can use the jQuery one on the DOM but it returns an array which
is actually a jQuery object which is based on the array type.  

in order to unwrap it from the array on the DOM do the following:
var heading = $("#page-title")  //press enter
heading.css({position: "relative"}); //press enter
heading.animate({left: 100;});  //press enter and it moves it to the right

it still needs to be unwrapped from the object array type::

heading[0]
//now it returns it unwrapped!! :)

heading[0].animate({left: 20});  //will not work!  it's unwrapped so animate won't work on it anymore

We can target an element on JS like so:
$("#lead-banner p");

jQuery filters always start with a colon :

What is Chaining in jQuery? a feature of jQuery that speeds up our code production by chaining multiple
methods or functions in one line of code using the . syntax

Wrapping and unwrapping using jQuery
    - Wrapped means that there is a parent element surrounding it
    
    -wrapping would be used for example if you want your end user to fill out a form before hitting a submit button.
    you'd wrap the button in a div that was styled to not be clickable until all the content was filed out
    and then once it's filled out it would unwrap the button so that they could submit it.
    
To use this on a button on the html it looks like this.

 <div class = "button" style="text-align:center; padding: 10px; background: orange;">Unwrap</div> <!--when i click this button i want to unwrap all the sections so that its no longer in the center and the contents expand the full width of the page-->

check out the wrap section on the js file to make it work
